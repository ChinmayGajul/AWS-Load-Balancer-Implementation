# AWS Load Balancer Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of a load balancer in AWS, involving the creation of multiple instances, custom AMI image creation, template setup, website hosting, EBS volume attachment, backup creation, load balancer configuration, and monitoring using CloudWatch.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a step-by-step process for setting up a load balancer in AWS and ensuring efficient distribution of traffic across multiple instances while maintaining high availability and scalability.

### Steps Involved

1. **EC2 Instance Creation**
   - Provisioned a new EC2 instance to host the website.
  
2. **Website Hosting**
   - Deployed a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the EC2 instance.

3. **EBS Volume Attachment**
   - Added a 5GB EBS volume to the EC2 instance.

4. **EBS Configuration via AWS CLI**
   - Accessed the instance using SSH through the AWS CLI and configured the newly added EBS volume.

5. **Snapshot Creation for Backup**
   - Generated a snapshot of the instance using EBS snapshot functionality for backup purposes.

6. **Custom AMI Creation**
   - Created a custom AMI image of the configured instance to replicate configurations across multiple instances.

7. **Template Creation**
   - Developed a template utilizing the created AMI image to facilitate consistent instance setup.

8. **Multiple Instance Creation**
   - Launched multiple instances using the created template to scale the infrastructure.

9. **Target Group Configuration**
   - Established a target group comprising all the created instances for load balancer utilization.

10. **Load Balancer Creation**
    - Set up a load balancer and routed traffic to the target group for balanced distribution.

11. **CloudWatch Monitoring**
    - Utilized CloudWatch services to monitor CPU utilization, RAM usage, and other metrics across instances for efficient resource management.

# Step-by-Step Setup Guide

This guide outlines the sequential process for setting up a load balancer in AWS, including the creation of multiple instances, AMI image generation, template creation, website hosting, EBS volume attachment, backup creation, load balancer configuration, and CloudWatch monitoring.

## 1. EC2 Instance Setup

### Action:
Create a new EC2 instance to host the website.

### Steps:
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click "Launch Instance" and follow the wizard to configure your instance (select instance type, configure instance details, add storage, configure security group, etc.).
4. Once launched, access the instance via SSH using your preferred terminal.

## 2. Website Hosting

### Action:
Host a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the EC2 instance.

### Steps:
1. Transfer your website files to the EC2 instance using secure methods like SCP or SFTP.
2. Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to serve the website content.

## 3. EBS Volume Attachment

### Action:
Attach an EBS volume of 5GB to the EC2 instance.

### Steps:
1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard and select the running instance.
2. Click "Actions" -> "Add/Edit Volume" to attach a new EBS volume.
3. Attach the volume to the instance and mount it to a specific directory if required.

## 4. AWS CLI Configuration

### Action:
Access the instance via SSH using the AWS CLI and configure the newly added EBS volume.

### Steps:
1. Use the AWS CLI to SSH into the instance.
2. Configure the attached EBS volume as needed (formatting, mounting, etc.).

## 5. Snapshot Creation for Backup

### Action:
Create a snapshot of the instance using EBS snapshot functionality for backup purposes.

### Steps:
1. Go to the EBS Volumes section in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select the volume and choose "Create Snapshot."
3. Add necessary details and create the snapshot.

## 6. Custom AMI Creation

### Action:
Generate a custom AMI image of the configured instance.

### Steps:
1. From the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance.
2. Choose "Actions" -> "Image and templates" -> "Create Image."
3. Provide image details and create the AMI.

## 7. Template Creation and Multiple Instance Launch

### Action:
Create a template using the created AMI image and launch multiple instances.

### Steps:
1. Access the AWS CloudFormation service.
2. Choose "Create Stack" -> "Create from Template" and upload the AMI image.
3. Configure the template settings and launch multiple instances.

## 8. Load Balancer and Target Group Configuration

### Action:
Set up a load balancer and configure a target group for balanced traffic distribution.

### Steps:
1. Go to the Load Balancers section in the EC2 Dashboard.
2. Create a new load balancer and configure it to route traffic to the target group.
3. Define the target group and add all instances to it.

## 9. CloudWatch Monitoring Setup

### Action:
Utilize CloudWatch to monitor instance metrics such as CPU utilization and RAM usage.

### Steps:
1. Access the AWS CloudWatch service.
2. Set up alarms and metrics to monitor CPU utilization, RAM usage, and other relevant metrics across instances.

# Notes

- **Security Considerations:** Ensure proper security configurations for instances, load balancer, and other resources.
- **Cost Monitoring:** Regularly monitor AWS billing and usage to prevent unexpected costs due to running instances or services.
- **Documentation:** Maintain documentation for configurations and changes made to AWS resources.
