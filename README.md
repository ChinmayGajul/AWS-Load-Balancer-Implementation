# AWS Load Balancer Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of a load balancer in AWS, involving the creation of multiple instances, custom AMI image creation, template setup, website hosting, EBS volume attachment, backup creation, load balancer configuration, and monitoring using CloudWatch.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a step-by-step process for setting up a load balancer in AWS and ensuring efficient distribution of traffic across multiple instances while maintaining high availability and scalability.

### Steps Involved

1. **EC2 Instance Creation**
   - Provisioned a new EC2 instance to host the website.
  
2. **Website Hosting**
   - Deployed a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the EC2 instance.

3. **EBS Volume Attachment**
   - Added a 5GB EBS volume to the EC2 instance.

4. **EBS Configuration via AWS CLI**
   - Accessed the instance using SSH through the AWS CLI and configured the newly added EBS volume.

5. **Snapshot Creation for Backup**
   - Generated a snapshot of the instance using EBS snapshot functionality for backup purposes.

6. **Custom AMI Creation**
   - Created a custom AMI image of the configured instance to replicate configurations across multiple instances.

7. **Template Creation**
   - Developed a template utilizing the created AMI image to facilitate consistent instance setup.

8. **Multiple Instance Creation**
   - Launched multiple instances using the created template to scale the infrastructure.

9. **Target Group Configuration**
   - Established a target group comprising all the created instances for load balancer utilization.

10. **Load Balancer Creation**
    - Set up a load balancer and routed traffic to the target group for balanced distribution.

11. **CloudWatch Monitoring**
    - Utilized CloudWatch services to monitor CPU utilization, RAM usage, and other metrics across instances for efficient resource management.
